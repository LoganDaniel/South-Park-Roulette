# South-Park-Roulette
This was the first project we were assigned after 3 months at the course. We were tasked with creating a Russian Roulette game using Windows Forms and message boxes.... Let's just say I went a little overboard but am very happy with the result

Note: You might want to lower your volume as the music can be very loud
